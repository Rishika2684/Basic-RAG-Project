#🚀 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project using LangChain & Groq API

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, the Groq API for fast inference with LLMs, and FAISS/Chroma as the vector database.
The system enhances language model outputs by retrieving relevant external knowledge and grounding responses in it, improving accuracy and reliability.
